# terraform-scripts

## How it works
1. Generate aws credentials in $HOME/.aws
    - You can easily generate using the repo [glowing spork](https://github.com/anderson-pids/glowing-spork)
2. Access the container with terraform
> make shell

After that, you can init, plan and apply terraform files into the `src` folder
